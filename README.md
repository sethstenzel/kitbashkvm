## Where to Buy?
I will be keeping built devices and kits on my tindie store.

## How to use?
Plug in a USBC cable to your laptop, and then one USBC cable and one HDMI cable to the machine you wish to controlling.
Next choose to either use the installation less Google Chrome Web Controller, or download a native Windows client from the Microsoft Store.

## Can I make my own?
ABSOLUTELY! Wiki instructions here on GitHub will detail how to build or use alternative parts.
